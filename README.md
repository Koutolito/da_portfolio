# INTRO 
This is a portfolio I created while following the Data Analysis Course on Alex The Analyst's Youtube Channel.
this course is exciting since it allowed me to review the basics that I already had in SQL and Excel but also allowed me to discover tools such as Python for data analysis and also Tableau. So in this GitHub repo, I have tried to organize the work in different branches.
